* ### Solving the Barchistochrone Problem with a Genetic Algorithm ([link](/[files]/projects/brachistochrone.pdf) and [Github](https://github.com/v715/Genetic-Brachistochrone))

    Use a genetic algorithm to find the least-time path between two points in 2-dimensional space assuming negligible friction and that all particles experience a uniform gravitational field.

* ### Virtual Pyano ([Github](https://github.com/v715/Virtual-Pyano))

    Developed a program to map spatial hand coordinates (captured using a [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/)) to a virtual piano.
